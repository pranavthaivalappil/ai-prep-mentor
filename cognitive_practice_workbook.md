## Logical Reasoning Problems

### Syllogisms
1. All students are learners. Some learners are curious. Therefore...
2. No cats are dogs. All pets are animals. Some animals are cats. Therefore...
3. All engineers solve problems. Some problem-solvers are creative. Therefore...

### Conditional Logic
1. If it's raining, I'll stay home. I'm not staying home. Is it raining?
2. Only if you study will you pass. You passed. Did you study?
3. When the alarm sounds, evacuate. The alarm is not sounding. Should you evacuate?

## Decision Making Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Project Management
You have 3 hours to complete 5 tasks:
- Task A: High priority, takes 1 hour
- Task B: Medium priority, takes 2 hours  
- Task C: Low priority, takes 30 minutes
- Task D: High priority, takes 45 minutes
- Task E: Medium priority, takes 1.5 hours

**Question:** How do you prioritize and schedule these tasks?

### Scenario 2: Team Conflict
Your team is behind schedule on a critical project. Two team members are arguing about the best approach. The deadline is in 2 days.

**Question:** What's your decision-making process?
